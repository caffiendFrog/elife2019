## Some notes on the papers in the corpus
(to facilitate building NLP tools)

PMC5080681 -- analyses Thymus bovei essential oils (compounds, antimicrobial and antithelmintic activity) ok paper because but they only try three times to extract oil, examine antibacterial and anthelmintic activity, then get a standard deviation from there. Only use few organisms (worms) to get anthelmintic activity. No comparison to similar species. Very standard methodology (GC-MS, looking at number of colonies of bacteria etc.)

# Instrumentations

In this study, the following instruments were used: Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) (QP-5000 GC-MS Shimadzu, Japan), ultrasonic-microwave cooperative extractor/reactor (CW-2000, China), rotary evaporator (Heidolph OB2000, VV2000, Germany), UV visible spectrophotometer (Jenway 7315, England), grinder (Moulinex model, Uno. China), balance (Radw ag, AS 220/c/2, Poland), filter paper (Machrery-Nagel, MN 617 and Whatman no.1, USA), micropipettes (Finnpipette, Finland), incubator (Nuve, Turkey), syringe filter 0.45 μm pore size (Microlab, China) and 96-well plates (Greiner bio-one, North America).

PMC6596282 -- this is actually a review of other papers so this might be interesting to extract some info. Somewhat systematic approach. It's about the stress reducing effects of essential oils during fish transport. E.g. tables 1 and 2 contain some interesting bits. Not much about equipment though.

PMC6602964 -- looks at activity of essential oils against larvae of a mosquito species that transmits yellow fever. I find reporting a bit questionable, in particular they don't really say what kind of statistical analysis they did, e.g. on extraction and analysis of the essential oils.

Adulticidal assay

The method described by Ramar et al. 69 was followed for adulticidal bioassay against Aedes aegypti, where acetone was used as a solvent. Initially, 100 and 1000 ppm concentration of each EO were tested against adult Aedes aegypti. 2 ml of each prepared solution was applied on Whatman no. 1 filter papers (size 12 × 15 cm 2) and allowed to evaporate acetone for 10 minutes. Filter paper treated with 2 ml of acetone alone was used as control. After evaporation of acetone, both the treated and the control filter paper were placed in cylindrical tubes (depth 10 cm). Ten numbers of 3–4 days old non-blood fed mosquitoes were transferred in each of the three replicas of each concentration. Based on the result of initial test, different concentrations of the selected oils were tested. Mortality was recorded at 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 5 hour, 6 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour respectively from the time of the mosquito released. LC50 value was calculated at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h of exposure period. If mortality exceeded 20% in the control batch, the whole test was repeated. Again, if mortality in the controls was above 5%, results with the treated samples were corrected using Abbott’s formula 68.

Analysis of effective essential oil components

For analysis of the constituent compounds of the selected EO, Gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A) and mass spectrometry (Accu TOF GCv, Jeol) was performed. GC was equipped with a FID detector and a capillary column (HP5- MS). The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The GC programme was set for Allium sativum as 10: 80- 1M- 8-220-5M-8-270-9M, for Ocimum sanctum as 10:80-3M-8-200-3M-10-275-1M-5-280, for Mentha piperita as 10:80-1M-8-200-5M-8-275-1M-5-280, for Eucalyptus maculata as 20,60-1M-10-200-3M-30-280, and for Callistemon linearis as 10: 60-1M-8-220-5M-8-270-3M respectively.

PMC6539503 -- maybe of interest because it's actually a false hit -- this is not about antimicrobial activity of plants, it's about gas and oil transportation in offshore pipelines.
