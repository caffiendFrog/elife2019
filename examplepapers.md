## Some notes on the papers in the corpus
(to facilitate building NLP tools)

PMC5080681 -- analyses Thymus bovei essential oils (compounds, antimicrobial and antithelmintic activity) ok paper because but they only try three times to extract oil, examine antibacterial and anthelmintic activity, then get a standard deviation from there. Only use few organisms (worms) to get anthelmintic activity. No comparison to similar species. Very standard methodology (GC-MS, looking at number of colonies of bacteria etc.)
