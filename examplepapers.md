## Some notes on the papers in the corpus
(to facilitate building NLP tools)

PMC5080681 -- analyses Thymus bovei essential oils (compounds, antimicrobial and antithelmintic activity) ok paper because but they only try three times to extract oil, examine antibacterial and anthelmintic activity, then get a standard deviation from there. Only use few organisms (worms) to get anthelmintic activity. No comparison to similar species. Very standard methodology (GC-MS, looking at number of colonies of bacteria etc.)
Journal: BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine

PMC6596282 -- this is actually a review of other papers so this might be interesting to extract some info. Somewhat systematic approach. It's about the stress reducing effects of essential oils during fish transport. E.g. tables 1 and 2 contain some interesting bits. Not much about equipment though.

PMC6602964 -- looks at activity of essential oils against larvae of a mosquito species that transmits yellow fever. I find reporting a bit questionable, in particular they don't really say what kind of statistical analysis they did, e.g. on extraction and analysis of the essential oils. 
Journal: Scientific Reports

PMC6539503 -- maybe of interest because it's actually a false hit -- this is not about antimicrobial activity of plants, it's about gas and oil transportation in offshore pipelines.
